1.  - Date: 07-02-2025
    - Memebers: Anirudh A, Raghavendra P
    - Decision: Anirudh is assigned to get the Software Design ready by 10-02-2025, Raghavendra to read more about the topics and brush up his knowledge of Python.

2.  - Date: 09-02-2025
    - Memebers: Anirudh A, Raghavendra P
    - Decision: Raghavendra was assigned to do the arithematic operations and Anirudh will do memory operations and thought about of the instruction which should be kept unique from risc-V set.

    - Decision:

4.  - Date: 13-02-2025
    - Memebers: Anirudh A, Raghavendra P
    - Decision: Decided to do the bubble sort algorithm combinely and added the data segment to the code by creating a data segment array which stores the input data from the program as in the format `arr: .word 0x4 ....`

5.  - Date: 15-02-2025
    - Memebers: Anirudh A, Raghavendra P
    - Decision: Decide to test the code with other programs using the dat segment format and checked for array addressing and sum of elements in the array problems and successfully acheived the correct output!!.

6.  - Date: 17-02-2025
    - Memebers: Anirudh A, Raghavendra P
    - Decision: Decided to implement `gui` for our simulator, Raghavendra worked firstly on basic gui platform which is directly supported by python by just importing the library (i.e) `import tkinter as tk  from tkinter import messagebox` but it is not that good for looking so we decided to do gui by using `html,css,javascript`.

7.  - Date: 19-02-2025
    - Memebers: Anirudh A, Raghavendra P
    - Decision: Raghavendra completed the gui (used html,css,javascript) and Anirudh worked on integrating this gui with python code and Anirudh decide to use `flask` for integration.
