Cores (4 processors: each has 32 registers, coreid (as in one reg should be hardwired to store the coreid), instructionid)
Memory (4kb worth, 1000 blocks of memory, each core can access 1kb of memory, no overlaps)

One sim class which connects all of this, has 4 core objects, 1 memory object and a program counter

functions the core should perform:
ADD, ADDI
SUB
BNE
JAL
LW
SW
+1 of our choice (?)

hinderance?
BNE, JAL: we need to maintain a history of code lines read inorder to jump back, we can use a dictionary to jump back to that line, the label is the key and udpdate the program counter to that instruction
LW: If the rs contains brackets, then it should move to that address in memory block, similar to SW



execute all the cores in parallel, using threadpoolexecutor
